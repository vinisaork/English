                <div class="rock fadeInLeft2"> The first appearance of music was around 10.000 thousand years before christ and it was a melody made by a improvised flute,, since then the culture of our world has completely changed and keeps changing every decade as also the music we listen.<br>
                    I often listen to music when I am studying or playing games, also when I am getting dressed before hang out, and the music I listen variety from every one of these activitys.<br>
                    When I am studying I tend to listen classical music because they can help you to "Think better" or also relaxing musics. Now when I am playing I often listen to rock or pop music because they increase the emotion of the game at least for me. For the cleaning I like to listen bachatas or salsa, I get the feeling that I am doing the shores faster.<br>
                    The fact is, music is always present in my life, and probably in yours too, and what is important is if you are having fun by listening them, as this is the main point of music since always.
