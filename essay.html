                    If we consider the price of branded clothes nowadays, then for sure the fashion industry is something bad for the majority of the population, However, there are plenty of cheaper alternatives that you can look good aswell. Something we all know is that appearance indeed are important, not only for social aspects but also for business as people will judge if you are not wearing matching outfits or branded clothing.<br>
                    On the other side, the fashion industry can also help by incentivizing you to be fitter, healthier wich going to also help with your high esteem, as a matter of fact people can become too obcessive if they are looking good wich can be very bad for their mental health.<br>
                    To sumarize, I would say that in the majority of the cases the fashion industry is something bad, but you can take some good point from it like getting healthier and increasing your self esteem.
